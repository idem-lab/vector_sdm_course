Course structure:

3 day course

Day 1:
AM:
- Welcome / icebreaker (ROpenSci activity - stand on a line thing)
- Introductory concepts and discussion. Slides and whiteboard.

PM:
- Simulate data
  - Abundance and relative abundance
  - bias
  - PA data from planned surveys (random, biased, abundance-biased)
  - understand how to simulate presence/absence from abundance
  - understand how to calculate probability of presence from average abundance
    * simulate_prob_presence.R
  - PO data from presence and bias process
  * prepare_raster_data.R - run through but encourage students to download files from figshare as travel and bioclim files are large.
  * simulate_data.R - students run through alongside instructors

Day 2:
AM:
- Modelling
  - Logistic regression on random PA data
  - Logistic regression on presence-only with random background
  * models.R- students run through alongside instructors
- Theory: link functions. Whiteboard and code.
  * link_demo.R


PM:
- Modelling
  - Maxent presence only with random background points
  - Maxent presence only with random bg and bias layer offset
  * models.R
  - students explore other PA data or other covariates if happy
- Theory: target-group background and bias cancellation

Day 3:
AM: 
- Modelling
  - Fithian PA-PO-bg model
  * models.R
  - continue explore alternatives from existing model set
- Theory: Fithian model
- Discussion: other topics in SDMs

PM:
- Modelling
  - own data and models
  - continue explore alternatives from existing model set
- Discussion
  - Papers
  - Own models and data
