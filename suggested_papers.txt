This paper by Stephen Phillips talks about the problem with failing to account for spatial sampling bias. I also introduces the target group background method: https://doi.org/10.1890/07-2153.1

This paper by Corey Merow gives a practical guide to using Maxent. It talks about the FactorBiasOut method (bias layer method) that we used: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0587.2013.07872.x


This paper by Will Fithian has another method for accounting for bias, that uses a small set of presence-absence data in conjunction to correct presence-only data for spatial sampling bias: https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12242

This paper by Guru Guillera-Arroita talks about when an SDM is ‘good enough’ for the purpose you are using it for - what you can and can’t do with different kinds of SDMs: https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12268

This paper is beyond the scope of our course; it’s a bit technical and less practical so don’t worry about reading it unless you are interested. It explains why Poisson point processes are the natural way of modelling presence-only data (and why MaxEnt is actually fitting a Poisson point process model): https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12352

And this other paper by Guru explains why you shouldn’t ever use maxent for modelling presence-absence data! (apparently some people do this): https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12252

This paper discusses the different types of validation metrics that are available for presence-only and presence-absence data, and which are appropriate for which purpose: https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12123

This paper by Jane Elith is a very practical and user-friendly introduction to using Boosted Regression Trees (a nice machine learning method) with a working application to species distribution modelling

This paper by Roozbeh Valavi compares how well a range of presence-only methods predict, and shows how you go about setting up and fitting your can make a difference
https://doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1486


This other paper of Jane Elith’s talks about how to model species that are in the process of spreading through a landscape: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2041-210X.2010.00036.x


And this *other* paper by Jane Elith describes the statistical model of maxent and talks about how  decisions you need to make in fitting your model in maxent. It's a must read for using maxent for SDMs.
